Note 1: Not 100% tested. CB = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
          2: As a transmitter, the device must provide an internal minimum delay time to bridge the undefined region 
             (minimum 300 ns) of the falling edge of SCL to avoid unintended generation of START or STOP conditions.
          3: The combined TSP and VHYS specifications are due to new Schmitt trigger inputs which provide improved 
             noise spike suppression. This eliminates the need for a TI specification for standard operation.
          4: This parameter is not tested but guaranteed by characterization. For endurance estimates in a specific appli-
             cation, please consult the Total Endurance Model which can be obtained on our BBS or website.
