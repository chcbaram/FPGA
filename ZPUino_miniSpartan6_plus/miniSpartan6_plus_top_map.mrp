  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <OV7670_PCLK> is placed at site <H1>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <OV7670_PCLK_BUFGP/BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X3Y16>. There
   is only a select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker
   buffer, and they are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem
   exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <OV7670_PCLK.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   slot12/wb_adr_i[5]_PWR_217_o_Mux_2_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1176 - Issue with pin connections and/or configuration
   on block:<zpuino/core/cache/cachemem/Mram_RAM1>:<RAMB16BWER_RAMB16BWER>.  The
   block is configured to use input parity pin DIBP0. There is dangling output
   for parity pin DOPB0.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1176 - Issue with pin connections and/or configuration
   on block:<zpuino/core/cache/cachemem/Mram_RAM2>:<RAMB16BWER_RAMB16BWER>.  The
   block is configured to use input parity pin DIBP0. There is dangling output
   for parity pin DOPB0.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1176 - Issue with pin connections and/or configuration
   on block:<zpuino/core/cache/cachemem/Mram_RAM3>:<RAMB16BWER_RAMB16BWER>.  The
   block is configured to use input parity pin DIBP0. There is dangling output
   for parity pin DOPB0.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   3 block(s) removed
   4 block(s) optimized away
   3 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "clkgen_inst/clk2_inst" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clkgen_inst/clk2" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "clkgen_inst/clkfx_inst_1mhz" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clkgen_inst/dcmclock_1mhz" is loadless and has been removed.
The signal "slot12/fb/N0" is sourceless and has been removed.
Unused block "clkgen_inst/DCM_inst_1mhz" (DCM_SP) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
GND 		slot12/fb/XST_GND
VCC 		slot12/fb/XST_VCC

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
